# Remember
A bare bones note app. Seriously bare bones. Built in an afternoon bare bones.
The intended use case is to store single thoughts to come back to later. 

```
Options:
      --list          list reminders
      --new <note>    create reminder
      --remove <num>  remove reminder
  -h, --help          Print help
```
